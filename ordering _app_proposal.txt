# Food Ordering Application - Project Proposal

## Project Description

The Food Ordering Application is a desktop-based Java application that 
enables customers to browse restaurants, view their menus, search for 
specific food items, and filter offerings by category or price. 
The application connects to a local SQLite database that stores 
information about restaurants, their menus, and food items with 
details such as name, category, and price. The system demonstrates 
core object-oriented design principles through a hierarchical class 
structure where different food types (drinks, soups, main courses, salads)
inherit from a common abstract `Food` base class. Users interact with 
the application through a Swing-based graphical user interface that 
allows them to perform searches across all restaurants, sort results 
by price, and view detailed menu information in an organized, 
user-friendly manner.

## Java Features and Concepts

**Object-Oriented Programming & Design**
- Abstract classes and inheritance (Food hierarchy with subclasses: Drink, Soup, MainCourse, Salad)
- Encapsulation (private fields with public getters/setters)
- Polymorphism (method overriding in Food subclasses)
- Composition (Restaurant contains Menu, Menu contains Food objects)

**Collections Framework**
- `List<Food>` for storing menu items
- `List<Restaurant>` for managing all restaurants
- `HashMap` or `TreeMap` for optimized data lookups where beneficial
- Iterators for traversing collections during search operations

**Database & JDBC**
- SQLite database connection using JDBC driver
- SQL queries to retrieve restaurant and menu data
- PreparedStatement for secure and efficient queries
- ResultSet mapping to Java objects

**GUI Development with Swing**
- JFrame for the main application window
- JPanel for organizing UI components
- JTable or JList for displaying restaurants and menu items
- JTextField for search functionality
- JComboBox for filtering by food type
- JButton for user interactions
- Layout managers (BorderLayout, GridLayout) for component arrangement
- Event listeners (ActionListener) for handling user input

**Additional Concepts**
- File I/O for database file management (.db file)
- Exception handling (try-catch blocks for JDBC operations)
- String manipulation and comparison for search operations
